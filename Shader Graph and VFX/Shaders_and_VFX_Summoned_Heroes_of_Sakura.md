# Shaders and VFX for Summoned Heroes of Sakura VR

I created eight unique shaders used in the Summoned Heroes of Sakura project. The shaders included fish, seaweed, wind, water, lava, terrain, crystal, and colour-changing sky. I created these shaders to bring movement and life to the Japanese Zen Garden and hell-themed battle area. I also made a handful of visual effects (VFX), including fog, flower petals, bubbles in the lava, and smoke from the lava. I created each shader using Shader Graph in Unity 2020.18.f and made the VFX using the particle effects in Unity.
